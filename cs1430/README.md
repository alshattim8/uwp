# CS1430 - Programming in C++ 
Intro class to basic programming and using the language C++.

## Labs
Lab assignments for this course. Often simple little programs to demonstrate a basic programming concepts.

### Lab 0
Simple payroll program.

### Lab 2
Simple program to compute the gross pay, deductions, and net pay for an employee.

### Lab 3
This program processes the output of a gumball sorter to tell how many red, green and yellow gumballs are put in a gumball machine.

### Lab 4
This program reads in pairs of positive integers and prints out the sum of all the integers between them, inclusive.

### Lab 5
This program reads three integers and finds and prints the minimum, and the sum of the quartics of the integers from 1 to the minimum.  
Assume the numbers entered are positive and do not validate them.

### Lab 6
This program reads a list of the number of cups of cider sold at the Harvest festival and displays the number of gallons, quarts, pints and cups were sold each day.  
It then tells the total amount served during the festival.

### Lab 7
This program reads a list of non-negative values and computes and displays the following statistics: the total numbers of grades, the average, the deviation from the average, and the number of grades below the average.

### Lab 8
This program prints a simple calendar.  
It reads in a date, writes out the date, then writes out the next consecutive 14 dates, one per line.

### Lab 9
This program prints a sales receipt based on the input sales information.

### Lab 10
This lab will give you practice using objects, arrays of objects as well as enumerated types.

### Lab 11
This program reads in a list of dates for a tour schedule, storing only good dates.  
It then prints the dates, sorts the dates in chronological order, and prints the sorted list of dates.
